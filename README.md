# Mission-to-Mars
# overview
## Purpose
The purpose of the project is to help scraping and adding the images of Mars’s hemispheres into the webpage. To do this, I used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, stored the scraped data on a Mongo database, used a web application to display the data, and altered the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
 For this I did the following things;
 - Scraped Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles.
 - Updated the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles.
 - Added Bootstrap 3 Components.

## Results
These are the images of the four hemispheres.
